# Conformance Files

All the YAML example files in this folder are used for validation testing of the specification as well as for conformance testing of the SDKs.
The structures are values are valid and up-to-date with the specification. The values do not bear special meaning though and should not be used as a reference when producing or consuming CDEvents.
