# Continuous Integration Events

__Note:__ This is a work-in-progress draft version and is being worked on by members of the Events SIG. You are very welcome to join the work and the discussions!

Continuous Integration (CI) events include the subject and predicates related to CI activities such as building software, producing artifacts and running tests.

## Subjects

This specification defines three subjects in this stage: `builds`, `artifacts` and `tests`. Events associated with these subjects are typically generated either by a CI system that orchestrates the process or by a specific build or test tool directly. Some artifact events may be generated by the system that stores the artifact as well.

| Subject | Description | Predicates |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| [`build`](#build) | A software build | [`queued`](#build-queued), [`started`](#build-started), [`finished`](#build-finished)|
| [`testCase`](#testcase) | A software test case | [`queued`](#testcase-queued), [`started`](#testcase-started), [`finished`](#testcase-finished)|
| [`testSuite`](#testsuite) | A collection of test cases | [`started`](#testsuite-started), [`finished`](#testsuite-finished)|
| [`artifact`](#artifact) | An artifact produced by a build | [`packaged`](#artifact-packaged), [`published`](#artifact-published)|

### `build`

A `build` is a process that uses a recipe to produce an artifact from source code.

__Note:__ The data model for `builds`, apart from `id` and `source`, only includes the identifier of the artifact produced by the build. The inputs to the build process are not specified yet.

| Field | Type | Description | Examples |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| id    | `String` | Uniquely identifies the subject within the source. | `1234`, `maven123`, `builds/taskrun123` |
| source | `URI-Reference` | [source](../spec.md#source) from the context | `staging/tekton`, `tekton-dev-123`|
| artifactId | `String` | Identifier of the artifact produced by the build | `0b31b1c02ff458ad9b7b81cbdf8f028bd54699fa151f221d1e8de6817db93427`, `927aa808433d17e315a258b98e2f1a55f8258e0cb782ccb76280646d0dbe17b5`, `six-1.14.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl`|

### `testCase`

A `testCase` is a process that performs a test against an input software artifact of some kind, for instance source code, a binary, a container image or else. A `testCase`  is the smallest unit of testing that the user wants to track. `testCases` are executed, and `testSuites` are for grouping purposes. For this reason, `testCases` can be queued.

__Note:__ The data model for `testCase` only includes `id` and `source`, inputs and outputs of the process are not specified yet, as well as the relation to `testSuite`.

| Field | Type | Description | Examples |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| id    | `String` | Uniquely identifies the subject within the source. | `unitest-abc`, `e2e-test1`, `scan-image1` |
| source | `URI-Reference` | [source](../spec.md#source) from the context | `staging/tekton`, `tekton-dev-123`|

### `testSuite`

A `testSuite` represents a set of one or more `testCases`.

__Note:__ The data model for `testSuite` only includes `id` and `source`, inputs and outputs of the process are not specified yet, as well as the relation to `testCase`.

| Field | Type | Description | Examples |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| id    | `String` | Uniquely identifies the subject within the source. | `unit`, `e2e`, `security` |
| source | `URI-Reference` | [source](../spec.md#source) from the context | `staging/tekton`, `tekton-dev-123`|

### `artifact`

An `artifact` is usually produced as output of a build process. Events need to be generated to indicate that an `artifact` has been packaged and released for others to use. These events can be produced by the artifact producer or by the artifact storage system.

| Field | Type | Description | Examples |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| id    | `String` | Uniquely identifies the subject within the source. | `abcde-12344-a2b35`, `sh0b31b1c02ff458ad9b7b81cbdf8f028bd54699fa151f221d1e8de6817db93427a1234`, `myimage@sha256:123456abcded`, `six-1.14.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl`|
| source | `URI-Reference` | [source](../spec.md#source) from the context | `staging/tekton`, `tekton-dev-123`|
