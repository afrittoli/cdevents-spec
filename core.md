# Continuous Delivery Core Events

__Note:__ This is a work-in-progress draft version and is being worked on by members of the Events SIG. You are very welcome to join the work and the discussions!

Continuous Delivery Core Events include the subjects and predicates related to orchestration of execution required to deterministically and continuously delivery software to users.
Core events are at the lower level of abstraction in the dictionary: they describe the status of an execution, but they don't include any semantic about the function of the execution itself. These events are generated by [pipeline orchestration engines](https://landscape.cd.foundation/card-mode?category=ci-pipeline-orchestration&grouping=category).

## Subjects

In the context of Continuous Delivery, a *pipeline* is the definition of a set of *tasks* that needs to be performed to build, test, package, release and deploy software artifacts.
The definition of *pipelines* and *tasks* is an authoring process, and has no event associated to it. CDEvents identifies two [*subjects*](./spec/README.md), [`PipelineRun`](#pipelinerun) and [`TaskRun`](#taskrun), which are the runtime counterparts of *pipelines* and *tasks*.

| Subject | Description | Predicates |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| [`PipelineRun`](#pipelinerun) | An instance of a *pipeline* | [`Queued`](#pipelinerun-queued), [`Started`](#pipelinerun-started), [`Finished`](#pipelinerun-finished)|
| [`TaskRun`](#taskrun) | An instance of a *task* | [`Started`](#taskrun-started), [`Finished`](#taskrun-finished)|

### `PipelineRun`

A pipeline can be instantiated multiple times, for example to build different
versions of the same artifact. We are referring to this instance as
[`PipelineRun`](#pipelinerun). It will have a unique ID and it will help us to
track the build and release progress on a particular software artifact.

| Field | Type | Description | Examples |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| ID    | `String` | Uniquely identifies the subject within the source. | `tenant1/12345-abcde`, `namespace/pipelinerun-1234` |
| Source | `URI-Reference` | [source](spec.md#source) from the context | |
| PipelineName  | `String` | The name of the pipeline | `MyPipeline`, `Unit tests for my repo` |
| Outcome | `Enum` | Outcome of a finished `PipelineRun` | `success`, `error` or `failure`|
| URL | `URI` | URL to the `PipelineRun` | `https://dashboard.org/namespace/pipelinerun-1234`, `https://api.cdsystem.com/namespace/pipelinerun-1234` |
| Errors | `String` | In case of error or failed pipeline, provides details about the failure | `Invalid input param 123`, `Timeout during execution`, `PipelineRun cancelled by user`, `Unit tests failed`|

### `TaskRun`

Pipelines are composed by as a set of Tasks to be performed, like performing a
build, running some tests, publishing an artifact. A TaskRun is an instance
of a Task, typically part of a pipeline. If a Pipeline is composed by a single
Task, the execution of PipelineRun MUST generate both the PipelineRun and
TaskRun events. Some systems may support execution of Tasks without a Pipeline
associated, in which case it is acceptable to generate only TaskRun events.

| Field | Type | Description | Examples |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| ID    | `String` | Uniquely identifies the subject within the source. | `tenant1/12345-abcde`, `namespace/taskrun-1234` |
| Source | `URI-Reference` | [source](spec.md#source) from the context | |
| TaskName  | `String` | The name of the pipeline | `MyPipeline`, `Unit tests for my repo` |
| PipelineRun | `Object` ([`PipelineRun`](#pipelinerun)) | The `PipelineRun` that this `TaskRun` belongs to. | `{"ID": "namespace/pipelinerun-1234"}`|
| Outcome | `Enum` | Outcome of a finished `TaskRun` | `success`, `error` or `failure`|
| URL | `URI` | URL to the `TaskRun` | `https://dashboard.org/namespace/taskrun-1234`, `https://api.cdsystem.com/namespace/taskrun-1234` |
| Errors | `String` | In case of error or failed pipeline, provides details about the failure | `Invalid input param 123`, `Timeout during execution`, `TaskRun cancelled by user`, `Unit tests failed`|

## Events

### `PipelineRun Queued`

Due the dynamic nature of Pipelines, most of actual work needs to be queued to
happen in a distributed way, hence Queued events are added. Adopters can choose
to ignore these events if they don't apply to their use cases.
